Welcome to PIMA Guitars!
        First, as you click to our link, you will be directed to the Main Page of the website. From there, you will be having options to choose from provided at the top (Navbar). 
The navbar consist of the following: About Page, Shop Products, Contact Us and the Cart icon as well as the sign out button. The about page, from the word itself, consist of 
everything about the said business, there you may read about the shop's ideals, history and their ongoing story, we also included the picture of the owner himself and the staffs.
The shop products on the other hand, displays all the available items/products that PIMA Guitars may offer, we have listed them and also included a short descriptions of them. And 
whenever a customer or user got any message, complaints or anything to say, we made the Contact Us page for them in order to have a way of communication of the owner and the 
customers themselves. Worry not as we made the contact form to be directed to the owner/bussiness's email whenever they send a message. And as for the cart icon, every product that
the user add's to cart will be transfered into the their cart, they can view their cart at the top of the featured items displayed, the price and the total price are also displayed
as well. As for their order history, we have encountered a bit of difficulty in creating one so we decided not to include that feature. Lastly, the sign out button is located at 
the top right of the website, from where the user can click whenever they feel like it. Also, before you can add an item into your cart, the user should log in into their account
first. An alert message will pop up and will direct the users to the log in form. And if they do not have an account for the shop yet, we also provided a sign up form for the to
fill up to make their own accounts. After filling up the forms, a pop up message will appear wether it went successfully or not, same goes on logging into their accounts. And if 
the user is an administrator, we had prepared another log in form for them, we also provided a sample account from they can access the admin privileges. This admin privileges are
to create, remove, update and delete a product that can be found in the Product Management page of the admin page. There is also the Order Management from where the orders of the 
user/customers will be seen/displayed but we have yet to create that one so we still have nothing for that feature.
